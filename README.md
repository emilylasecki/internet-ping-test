# Internet Ping Test

This code pings google.com and reports on how much time passes in milliseconds between the time the request is sent and response is recieved. Based on what experiment you wish to run, you may want to modify the code to get accurate results.

In the sample file, experiment1.xlsx, two trials were run. One where no devices were on the network, and another where one Nintendo Switch is connected and playing Splatoon 3. The data from every request is exported to excel, where I manually reported on the means and variance of the two samples. The data is approximately normal since we take a large amount of samples with a continous distribution. I tested the null hypothesis pictured below

Because of our conclusions we can determine that Splatoon 3 has a significant impact on the latency of the network.

From here I performed some tests on the internet and after I got it working, ran another test with Splatoon 3 running. This time, the variance was much closer to that of the control trial, indicating that the internet latency problem should be fixed. To confirm this, I did the same test of the difference between 2 population samples, this time using the control and fixed internet trial. The results are as follow.
